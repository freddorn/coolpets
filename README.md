## Testing

### Automated Testing
- [Travis](https://travis-ci.org/) was used throughout the unit testing of this project to provide continuous integration with the deployed site.
  - In the heroku deployment settings, it will only allow deployment, when Travis CI has passed the latest push to the master branch on GitHub.

- Unittests in combination with the coverage.py testing tool.


### Manual Testing
- All python pages are mostly PEP8 compliant, with four instances of the `line too long` error.
  - Disregarded the message as I could not find an alernative format for each instance.

- The W3C Jigsaw validator does not recognize root variables, and therefore passes **Parse Errors**.

- When validating Javascript, the following errors appeared as the validator could not recognize JQuery or Stripe:
  - '$' is not defined.
  - "STRIPE" is not defined.

- All images are displaying properly.

- Links and URLs are working correctly.

- The Responsiveness of the site is good at all screen sizes.

- All pages are rendering as expected.

- The back-end functionality is working as expected.

- Stripe payments is operating properly.

### Validators
* [AutoPrefixer](https://autoprefixer.github.io/)
    - To make sure the css code is valid for all browsers.

* [W3C CSS validation](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/)
    - To check the the validity of the CSS code. 
    
* [W3C Markup Validation](https://validator.w3.org/)
    - To check the the validity of the HTML code. 

* [Javascript Syntax Validator](https://esprima.org/demo/validate.html)
    - Checks for javascript mistakes and errors.
    
* [JS Hint](https://jshint.com/)
    - Validates javascript and checks for errors.

### Compatibility

To ensure a broad range of users can successfully use the site, I tested different browsers in both desktop and mobile configuration, for appearance and responsiveness.

- **Chrome**
  - Tested Good 
- **Edge** 
  - Tested Good
- **Firefox**
  - Tested Good
- **Safari** 
  - Tested Fair
- **Opera** 
  - Tested Good

#### Bugs Fixed

I originally had each python test in the test directory of each app. It was causing Travis CI to have a Failed Build error. The tests were moved to a 
Tests directory, at the root level, to prevent this problem.



## Deployment

### Local Deployment

Before you are able to deploy and run this application locally, you must have the following installed on your system:

- [Python3](https://www.python.org/downloads) to run the application.
- [PIP](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing) to install all app requirements.
- An IDE of your choice, such as [Gitpod](https://https://www.gitpod.io/).
- [GIT](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/install-git) for cloning and version control.

Also it would be beneficial to have free accounts set up for the following services:
- AWS S3
- Stripe
- Emailjs

Next, perform the following steps:

Clone this GitHub repository by either clicking the green *Clone or download* button and downloading the project as a zip-file (remember to unzip it first), or by entering the following into the Git CLI terminal:
    - `git clone https://github.com/freddorn/coolpets.git`.
- Navigate to the correct file location after unpacking the files.
    - `cd <path to folder>`
- Create a `.env` file containing the following environmental variables:
    - ***STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE*** - Used solely to identify your account with Stripe; it isn't secret.
    - ***STRIPE_SECRET*** -  Can perform any API request to Stripe without restriction.
    - ***STRIPE_CANCEL_URL***
    - ***STRIPE_SUCCESS_URL***
    - ***SECRET_KEY*** - Standard secret key, any value.
    - ***HOSTNAME***
    - ***AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID*** - AWS user credentials.
    - ***AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY*** - AWS S3 credentials.
    - ***AWS_STORAGE_BUCKET_NAME***
    - ***DATABASE_URL*** - Remote PostgreSQL database link if using a remote database.



- Install all requirements from the requirements.txt file using this command:
    - `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`

- At the terminal prompt, type ```python3 manage.py runserver```. Django should now start running a development server from 'http://127.0.0.1:8000'. 

    Running the project for the first time will cause Django to create a SQLite3 database named ```db.sqlite3```. Type the following command into the terminal to create the database schema:
    - `python3 manage.py migrate`

    Django will then migrate the files contained in the migrations folder to create a database schema.


### Remote Deployment

To implement this project on Heroku, the following must be completed:

1. Create the **requirements.txt** file so Heroku knows what dependencies are needed, with the command `pip3 freeze > requirements.txt`
2. Create a **Procfile** to tell Heroku what type of application is being deployed, and how to run it.
3. Sign up for or log into your Heroku account, create your project app, and click the **Deploy** tab. Select *Connect GitHub* as the Deployment Method, and select *Enable Automatic Deployment*.
4. In the Heroku **Settings** tab, click on the *Reveal Config Vars* button to configure environmental variables as in the local deployment above.
5. In the **Resources** tab, go to the Add-ons section and add the Heroku Postgres add-on. Choose the *Hobby* level when prompted. This will give you a remote database to use for your project. The database URI will be located in the Config Vars in the **Settings** tab.
6. The app will now be deployed and built by Heroku and will be ready to run.
7. Alter your project's ```settings.py``` file to connect to the remote database using the ```dj_database_url``` Python package.
8. Follow the steps in the Local Deployments section above to migrate your schema to the remote database.
